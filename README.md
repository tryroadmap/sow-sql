# sow-sql
A simple template has been developed for quicker query write-ups using GPT-4. Scope of Work (SOW) for query write-ups is a crucial aspect of most daily analyst roles. Data is often queried from multiple tables to achieve specific goals, and having clear expected column titles as output is essential. This presents an excellent opportunity for leveraging GPT-4 to review and complete partially developed query scripts.


To facilitate this process, a clear scheme of all available tables is required. Scope of Work documents can be found within the "sow" folder, containing queries of varying complexities, ranging from easy to medium.


Using GPT-4 for query write-ups not only improves efficiency but also ensures accuracy and consistency in the analytical process. The template enables analysts to focus on formulating high-quality queries and gaining valuable insights from the data.
